## OpenCafe infdev 0.1.3SA
The goal is to create an open-source platform for small cafes and restaurant startups.  
Instead of relying on proprietary software, a startup can configure OpenCafe for their needs,  
all you need is a web-server and a bit of effort. You can dynamically modify what are you offering at the moment, 
keep track of your customers and their orders that they make from the mobile app in the admin panel and more! 

### Projects under active development: 
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ztrixdev/OpenCafe/tree/main/server">Server</a> - an ASP.NET Core-based server that handles all requests</li>
</ul>

### Projects TODO:
<ul>
<li>AP - the WebApp for admins to control your OpenCafe instance</li>
<li>OCM - OpenCafe Mobile, the WebApp for customers to make orders, view the menu etc.</li>
</ul>
